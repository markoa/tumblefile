h1. Tumblefile

An automatic, chronological file organizer for GNOME Linux.

Every five minutes Tumblefile copies all files on your Desktop to a folder such as ~/Documents/2009-07-July/25-Saturday, prepending a timestamp (like 20090727.1645) to the filename. Meanwhile its little window sits in the system tray. It is a way to automatically keep your Desktop cleared and files organized.

Kudos for the original idea goes to Luke Crawford's "drefile for OS X":http://tlvx.net/post/130689108/drefile-an-automatic-chronological-file.

h2. Installation

Download "the latest tarball":http://github.com/markoa/tumblefile/downloads, then compile it:

<pre><code>  # On Debian-based systems:
  sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-2.4-dev

  tar -xzvf tumblefile-x.y.tar.gz
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install</code></pre>

h2. How it runs

When you launch Tumblefile for the first time, it will set up what it takes to run automatically the next time log in. You can turn that off in System > Preferences > Startup Applications.

Tumblefile also works from command line. From terminal, you can type

<pre><code>  $ tumblefile /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2</code></pre>

and it will move the files in the usual way.
