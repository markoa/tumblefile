Tumblefile is an automatic, chronological file organizer for GNOME Linux.

Every five minutes Tumblefile copies all files on your Desktop to
a folder such as ~/Documents/2009-07-July/25-Saturday, prepending
a timestamp (like 20090727.1645) to the filename. Meanwhile its
little window sits in the system tray. It is a way to automatically
keep your Desktop cleared and files organized.

Kudos for the original idea goes to drefile for OS X:

When you launch Tumblefile for the first time, it will set up what it takes to run automatically the next time log in. You can turn that off in System > Preferences > Startup Applications.

Tumblefile requires gtkmm library and is GPL licensed.
